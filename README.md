# ClassicCipher
This is simple Android application for ciphering or deciphering text using Classic Cipher.

The allowable key for this cipher is any arbritary integer, divided by 26, and the remainder is the useful key.

The known limitations of this application include:
1. It does not recognize any punctuation mark. The valid input may only be ordinary English alphabet and space.
2. It cannot differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letter. All input is converted to lowercase before being encoded/decoded.
   Therfore, the output is obviously lowercase.
